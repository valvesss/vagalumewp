# Vagalume Wrapper
![](logo/vagalume-logo.png)

Vagalume WP helps you to use Vagalume API's. API's wrapped by VagalumeWP are explorable
and follow a simple interaction pattern that works uniformly so developers don't need to learn how to use a new coding interface/style for each service API.

It provides librarys to search by genre, artists, musics, lyrics, albums and discographys.
